# Solodex

This is a project to basically make a place to keep important things you want to remember, but instead of putting them in the cloud, you can just keep them on your own device.

Examples of things that you might want to put in the solodex:

- Names of friends' spouses (I'm always forgetting these)
- Names of childrens' friends (ditto)
- Names of childrens' friends' parents (you get the idea)

...but could also just be things you're thinking about for the future and don't feel like emailing yourself (I used to do this all the time), or setting up a slack reminder (I still do a lot of this):

- ideas for birthday presents for friends and family members
- dates of birthdays of friends and family members (maybe we could even set up some reminders)
- specific foods that people like
- specific food allergies that people have
- etc...

The idea is that there are numerous cloud-based services for this, but not really anything that you can infinitely customize for whatever kinds of nested notes you want (if that exists, please let me know and I can stop this foolish project immediately!).
